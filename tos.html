                <li>THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SERVICE</li>
              </h2>
                <p>
                  This initiative is designed to assist users who have a poor internet connection or do not intend to consume much of their mobile data package to share documents, media or any file of any size over the internet by simply generating links that can be shared and accessed by the intended viewers. This service allows users to download files that are either their intellectual property or are not copyrighted (such as Copyleft, Creative Commons, etc.). For example; you have a song and want to share with thousands of people, you don't have to send to each and every person but simply generate a shareable link. Thousands will download/stream your song through the generated link.


                </p>
                <h2>
                  <li>CONDUCT OF USE OF THIS SERVICE</li>

                <p>
                  You agree not to use this Service to download, transmit, store, or otherwise make available any Content that is illegal, harassing, threatening, harmful, tortious, defamatory, libelous, abusive, violent, pornographic, vulgar, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, racially or ethnically insulting. It will also not violate any copyright or other intellectual property rights, nor will it divulge any trade secret or sensitive information in violation of a confidentiality, employment, or non-disclosure agreement.<br>
                  You're likely to be permanently banned if behavior that is not in accordance with the conduct of use occurs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Your documents, media or files can never be accessed by anyone unless you share the generated link and those files will be publicly accessible to anyone who has received the link or share. Therefore the privacy of your files dwells with you, share the links, the files get published. Note sharing of offensive video or copyrighted materials is prohibited and may incur legal responsibilities.<br>
                  If you allow others to access your data (e.g. by giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.
